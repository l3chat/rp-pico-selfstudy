# RP2040 / RP2350 (Pico / Pico 2) — Self-Study Course

This repository is a complete self-study course that you can build and follow
locally using **VS Code + the Codex extension**.

## Students: start here
- Local/student entry page: `STUDENT_START_HERE.md`
- Published student entry page: `docs/student-start-here.md`

## Key principles
- Lessons are **90 minutes** each.
- Every lesson ends with an **assessment** (quiz + practical task + rubric).
- The course assumes **no prior knowledge** of:
  - Python
  - C
  - C++
- The course is authored and maintained **using Codex only**
  (no GitHub Copilot instructions, and ideally no ChatGPT chat needed).

## Where things live
- `PLAN.md`        — course roadmap / checklist
- `MEMORY.md`      — project memory (decisions, conventions, open questions)
- `AGENTS.md`      — instructions for Codex (how to work inside this repo)
- `lessons/`       — lesson sources (overview + assessment + code)
- `docs/`          — published standalone learner pages (GitHub Pages-friendly)
- `projects/`      — longer-running code projects (MicroPython + Pico SDK)
- `.codex/`        — Codex configuration + reusable prompts/templates

## Publishing
GitHub Pages can serve `/docs` directly (Settings → Pages → main → /docs).
