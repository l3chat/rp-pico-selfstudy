# RP2040 / RP2350 Pico Self-Study Course Plan (Pico / Pico 2 / RP2040-Zero / RP2350-Zero, 90-minute lessons)

Legend: ☐ not started · ☐ in progress · ☑ done

## Board coverage policy
- Core board targets for lessons:
  - Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040)
  - Raspberry Pi Pico 2 (RP2350)
  - RP2040-Zero
  - RP2350-Zero
- Hardware lessons should call out board-specific differences when known.
- If a detail is uncertain (pin mapping, LED pin, voltage), mark TODO and record
  it in `MEMORY.md`.

## Standard lesson timing (90 minutes)
- 10 min: orientation (goals, setup, expected outcome)
- 55 min: guided build (steps + checkpoints)
- 10 min: concept reflection (“explain it back”)
- 15 min: assessment (quiz + practical task + rubric)

## Module 0 — Development environment and language crash courses (no prior knowledge)

☐ L00 VS Code development environment (for this course)
   - Install VS Code
   - Install required extensions
   - Serial monitor workflow (USB CDC / UART adapter options)
   - Pico SDK build workflow (CMake + toolchain)
   - MicroPython upload workflow
   - Codex workflow inside the repo:
     - how to use AGENTS.md
     - how to use .codex/prompts
     - how to update MEMORY.md + PLAN.md

☐ L0A Python crash course (for MicroPython + tooling)
   - variables, types, functions
   - conditionals, loops
   - modules, files
   - minimal debugging habits

☐ L0B C crash course (for embedded SDK code)
   - compilation model, headers, functions
   - pointers (intro), arrays, structs
   - memory model mental picture (stack vs static vs heap)

☐ L0C C++ crash course (minimal for Pico SDK)
   - what changes vs C
   - references vs pointers (conceptual)
   - constructors/destructors idea (conceptual)
   - “use C first, C++ later” rule of thumb

## Module 1 — Pico foundations (MicroPython + Pico SDK)

☐ L01 Setup & flashing (MicroPython + Pico SDK “hello world”)
☐ L02 GPIO output + input + pull-ups + debouncing
☐ L03 Timing: delays vs timers + PWM basics
☐ L04 UART logging + simple command console

☐ L04A Nonvolatile storage (EEPROM equivalent on RP2040/RP2350)
   - Why there is no classic EEPROM (typical on AVR) and what exists instead
   - Flash basics: erase blocks, write granularity, wear considerations
   - Safe patterns:
     - small config struct with version + checksum
     - append-only log + compaction
   - MicroPython option: file-based config (if filesystem available)
   - Pico SDK option: flash programming API + simple KV store
   - Assessment: store and retrieve a calibration/config value across reboot

---

## Module 2 — Communication and real devices

☐ L05 I2C basics + error handling
   - scanning the bus
   - addressing
   - retry strategy and timeouts

☐ L05A Temperature/Humidity/Pressure sensor (THP) via I2C
   - choose a common module (e.g., BME280-class) and read:
     temperature, humidity, pressure
   - data conversion and units
   - basic filtering (moving average)
   - output to serial console in a stable format
   - Assessment: implement “sensor health” checks (range validation + retry)

☐ L05B Button matrix scanning (local keyboard)
   - row/column wiring and why diodes may be needed (ghosting)
   - scanning loop and debouncing strategy
   - mapping matrix coordinates to key codes
   - output pressed keys to serial
   - Assessment: implement N-key rollover behavior limits and document them

☐ L06 SPI throughput + display/ADC (choose 1 device)
☐ L07 Interrupts: GPIO + timer + safe shared state

---

## Module 3 — RP “superpowers”

☐ L08 PIO intro: waveform generator
☐ L09 PIO: custom protocol (choose a target)
☐ L10 DMA: continuous sampling into ring buffer

---

## Module 4 — Architecture & product skills

☐ L11 Dual-core patterns: queues, producer/consumer
☐ L12 Low power modes: compare RP2040-family vs RP2350-family boards
☐ L13 USB device: CDC serial
☐ L14 USB HID device (keyboard or mouse)
   - (This can optionally reuse the button matrix from L05B)

---

## Capstone (2 lessons)

☐ L15 Capstone build (choose one final project)
☐ L16 Capstone polish: docs, tests, release tag

---

## Deliverables per lesson
- /lessons/Lxx-*/overview.md
- /lessons/Lxx-*/assessment.md
- /lessons/Lxx-*/code/ (working examples)
- published output generated by CI from lesson sources (no duplicated docs tree)
