# Student Start Here

Use this page as your main student entry point.

## Learning path
1. Open the published entry page: `docs/index.md`.
2. Read the short student guide: `docs/student-start-here.md`.
3. Start with the first available lesson in `docs/syllabus.md`.
4. For each lesson, use the full source lesson in `lessons/<lesson-id>/`:
   - `overview.md` for the 90-minute walkthrough
   - `code/` for runnable examples
   - `assessment.md` for quiz + practical + rubric

## Recommended workflow per lesson
1. Read `overview.md` fully before running commands.
2. Run the lesson code exactly as written.
3. If something fails, use the lesson troubleshooting lines first.
4. Complete `assessment.md` at the end.
5. Write your own short notes in `lessons/<lesson-id>/notes.md`.

## How to read repo folders
- `docs/` = short published learner pages.
- `lessons/` = full detailed lesson sources.
- `projects/` = longer project work.
- `PLAN.md` = overall roadmap and lesson status.

## Current scope reminder
- If a lesson still contains many `TODO` placeholders, treat it as not yet complete.
- Use `docs/syllabus.md` to see currently available published lessons.
