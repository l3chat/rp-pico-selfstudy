# Student Start Here

Use this page as your main student entry point.

## Learning path
1. Open the published entry page: `docs/index.md`.
2. Read the student guide: `docs/student-start-here.md`.
3. Start with the first available lesson in `docs/syllabus.md`.
4. Use each published lesson page in `docs/lessons/` as your primary lesson.
5. Use `lessons/<lesson-id>/` when you want source files or runnable code:
   - `overview.md` and `assessment.md` are authoring source
   - `code/` contains runnable examples

## Recommended workflow per lesson
1. Read the lesson page in `docs/lessons/` fully before running commands.
2. Run the lesson code exactly as written from the matching `lessons/<lesson-id>/code/` path.
3. If something fails, use the lesson troubleshooting lines first.
4. Complete the assessment section at the end of the lesson page.
5. Write your own short notes in `lessons/<lesson-id>/notes.md`.

## How to read repo folders
- `docs/` = published standalone learner pages.
- `lessons/` = lesson source files + runnable code.
- `projects/` = longer project work.
- `PLAN.md` = overall roadmap and lesson status.

## Current scope reminder
- If a lesson still contains many `TODO` placeholders, treat it as not yet complete.
- Use `docs/syllabus.md` to see currently available published lessons.
