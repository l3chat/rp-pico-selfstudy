# Student Start Here

Use this page as your main student entry point.

## Learning path
1. Open `PLAN.md` to see the roadmap.
2. Start with the first available lesson in `lessons/`.
3. For each lesson:
   - read `overview.md`
   - run files in `code/`
   - complete `assessment.md`

## Recommended workflow per lesson
1. Read `overview.md` fully before running commands.
2. Run the lesson code exactly as written.
3. If something fails, use lesson troubleshooting lines first.
4. Complete `assessment.md` at the end.
5. Write short notes in `lessons/<lesson-id>/notes.md`.

## Publishing model
- Source of truth is only `lessons/`.
- A static website is generated by `scripts/build_site.py`.
- GitHub Actions deploys generated `site/` to GitHub Pages.
- No hand-written lesson copies are stored in `docs/`.
